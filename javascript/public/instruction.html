            <h3>Experiment procedure</h3>

            <h4>Before you start: consent forms</h4>
            <p>
                Our study offers free AI online courses. You could also receive compensation (maximum: $90) after this
                study. Note that we only recruit students who <span
                    class="highlighted mark">do not have or have rare</span> previous experience in AI. If you have rich
                experience in AI-related techniques like machine learning, please do not join in our study. The study
                procedure is depicted below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before study, first <span class="highlighted mark">sign the consent form</span> in <code>Consent
                forms</code> block by clicking <code>eSign</code> button. After you have signed it in DocuSign, check
                the box stating that <code>By checking this box, I confirm that I have signed the consent form in the
                study.</code> and click <code>Submit</code> button.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: you MUST use your <span class="highlighted mark">UCSD email</span> to <span class="highlighted">sign the consent form</span>
                on DocuSign and <span class="highlighted">participate in our study</span>. If you do not sign the
                consent form or use non-UCSD emails in DocuSign and study, your study results will be removed
                automatically.
            </p>

            <h4>Lectures to complete</h4>

            <p>
                The following list is the lectures to be completed. The formal study is composed of Lecture 1 to 4 and
                two short questionnaires.
            </p>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Introduction to the system. (~6 mins)</li>
                    <li>Lecture 1. (~30 mins)</li>
                    <li>The first questionnaire. (~1 mins)</li>
                    <li>Lecture 2. (~30 mins)</li>
                    <li>Lecture 3. (~30 mins)</li>
                    <li>Lecture 4. (~30 mins)</li>
                    <li>The second questionnaire. (~1 mins)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>


            <p>
                Each lecture includes one 30-min course video and two tests of 10 short questions, where one before the
                lecture and another one after the lecture.

                You need to <span class="highlighted mark">finish both tests</span>. Otherwise, the lecture is not
                viewed as finished and you could not receive compensation for this lecture.
            </p>

            <p>
                After you finish lecture 1/lecture 4, you need to finish the corresponding questionnaire in <code>How is
                your experience</code> block.

                Otherwise, you could not receive compensation for lecture 1/lecture 4.
            </p>

            <p>
                We suggest you have at least a 10-min rest between lectures.
            </p>

                <p class="mb-0"> If you have joined our previous online learning study using this system before Nov 23,
                    you could not participate in this study again. We will check the participant email account in our
                    previous study. Even if you participate in our study again, you will not receive any
                    compensation.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Do not forget these!</h3>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">Chrome, PC, Volume</span>. Do not use any other browsers. Use
                        your
                        computer (not phones, not tablets). Do not forget to open your sound/volume to hear the
                        instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">Stable Internet</span>. The lecture could not pause and resume.
                        Therefore, make sure your Internet connection is stable and do not refresh your webpage during
                        the lecture. Otherwise, you may have to start from the beginning of the lecture.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">No Interruption</span>. Make sure you have enough time (30-35
                        min)
                        without being interrupted before you start each lecture because the lecture could not pause.
                        Otherwise you have to repeat this lecture.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">Camera, Face</span>. You need to enable your camera on Chrome and
                        show
                        your face without a mask during the courses. If your face could not be detected all the time,
                        you will lose the access to the courses. As depicted in the consent form, your face and eye gaze
                        will only be used for research purposes and will not be released to the public.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">Video Gets Stuck</span>. If your lecture gets stuck, it may be
                        due to your unstable Internet connection. Please wait for a while and it may resume later. If it
                        could not resume after 10 minutes, please send an email <span class="highlighted mark">containing
                        the screenshot of your current problem<span></span> to us and we'll fix it soon.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">Be Honest</span>. Please do not cheat in the tests since joining
                        in a
                        research study is a serious thing. Our system could detect your cheating. If we find that you
                        cheat during the tests or just make quick and random selections, you will be removed from our
                        courses and receive zero compensation. If you submit your answers multiple times in the tests,
                        we will only use your <span class="mark highlighted">first submitted answers</span>. If your
                        response time in the tests is abnormal
                        (too fast or too slow), your results will be suspected as cheating as well.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="mark highlighted">Completion</span>. Be sure to remember the 4-digit code that is
                        assigned to you after you finish the pre-test/post-test and submit the code in the corresponding
                        location. If you fail to finish this last step, your current lecture will not be viewed as
                        completion and you have to repeat it if you want to proceed to the next lecture. If you forget
                        the 4-digit code and repeat your pre-test/post-test, <span class="mark highlighted">please be
                        sure to notify us that you have repeated it via email</span>.

                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>If you have finished four lectures, you could have the chance to compare your performance in the average
                accuracy and response time of <span class="highlighted mark">post-lecture tests</span> of all lectures
                with other participants. Note that your
                <span class="highlighted">pre-lecture tests</span> score will not affect your rewards. We will give
                additional rewards for top N participants in
                post-test scores, out of the total 40 participants:
            </p>

            <table class="table">

                <tr>

                    <th scope="col">2 - 3</th>
                    <th scope="col">4 - 8</th>

            </table>

            <p>
                So the final compensation for all 40 participants who have finished four lectures is:

            </table>

            <p>
                We will first compare your average accuracy. For participants with the same accuracy, we compare your
                response time, i.e. how much time you have spent on the tests.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system will be closed after 40 participants have completed all four lectures so that no other
                participants could join. For other participants who do not finish all lectures before we close our
                system, we will provide you with compensation according to your progress, i.e. $5 for each lecture.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that you will not receive any compensation if you do not follow study instructions, including:
            </p>

            <div>
                <ul>

                    <li>The same person to join in the study with different UCSD emails</li>
                    <li>Do not sign the consent form before using our system to learn courses</li>
                    <li>Do not use UCSD emails</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Your compensation will be released to your UCSD email in the form of an Amazon e-Gift Card. So make sure
                you input your UCSD email correctly. After you have completed your study, email <a
                    href="mailto:soxu@ucsd.edu">soxu@ucsd.edu<a> to confirm your completion and request your
                compensation.
